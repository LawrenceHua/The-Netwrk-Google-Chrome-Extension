# Methodical AI Research Approach - IMPLEMENTED

## Overview

I've completely rewritten the AI research flow to be **methodical and thorough** as requested. Each step now takes time to ensure complete data extraction before moving to the next step.

---

## 🎯 New Research Flow

### **Step 1: Main Profile (Name, Headline, About)**
```javascript
1. Navigate to LinkedIn URL
2. Wait 8 seconds for page to load
3. Wait 3 more seconds for page to settle
4. Extract name from header (multiple selectors + fallbacks)
5. Extract headline from profile
6. Methodical About section extraction:
   - Scroll to find About section
   - Click all "see more" buttons
   - Wait 3 seconds after each click
   - Extract expanded About content
7. VALIDATE: Must have name before continuing
```

### **Step 2: Experience Page (/details/experience/)**
```javascript
1. Navigate to /details/experience/
2. Wait 10 seconds for experience page to load
3. Methodical scrolling (6 positions: 0, 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500px)
4. Wait 2 seconds after each scroll
5. Click "see more" buttons for individual experiences
6. Wait 2 seconds after each click
7. Extract job titles and companies
8. Extract skills from page text
```

### **Step 3: Contact Info (/overlay/contact-info/)**
```javascript
1. Navigate to /overlay/contact-info/
2. Wait 8 seconds for overlay to load
3. Extract emails and phone numbers
4. Return to main profile
5. Wait 6 seconds for main profile to reload
```

### **Step 4: Comments Page (/recent-activity/comments/)**
```javascript
1. Navigate to /recent-activity/comments/
2. Wait 10 seconds for comments page to load
3. Methodical scrolling (7 positions over 6 months)
4. Wait 3 seconds after each scroll
5. Check for 6-month limit indicators
6. Extract ONLY comments with @ symbols
7. Remove duplicate comments
8. Return to main profile
9. Wait 6 seconds for main profile to reload
```

### **Step 5: AI Analysis**
```javascript
1. Generate comprehensive profile with ALL collected data
2. Send to OpenAI via /api/analyze-job-seeker-comprehensive
3. Get job seeker score, indicators, and analysis
4. Combine all data into final profile
5. Save to dashboard
```

## 🧪 Ready to Test

The system now:
1. **Takes time** on each LinkedIn page to get complete data
2. **Validates name** before continuing (stops if name not found)
3. **Waits for page loads** and content expansion
4. **Filters comments** to only those with @ symbols
5. **Sends comprehensive data** to OpenAI for job seeker assessment
6. **Displays all prospects** in one scrollable dashboard list

Each profile will take 1.5-2 minutes to research thoroughly, but the data quality will be much higher!
