## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### No profiles collected
1. Check if you're on LinkedIn search page
2. Check console for "URLCollector already loaded"
3. Reload page and try again
4. Check if content script is injected (look for green ✅ in console)

### Research hangs/freezes
1. Check if backend server is running
2. Check network tab for failed requests
3. Research may take 5-10 minutes - be patient
4. Look for error messages in console

### Profiles missing data
1. Check if "see more" buttons were clicked (console will show)
2. Some profiles may not have all data (normal)
3. Check if AI backend returned data

---

## 📝 Notes

- **LinkedIn Rate Limits:** If you search too many profiles too fast, LinkedIn may temporarily block
- **Research Time:** Each profile takes 5-10 minutes due to multiple page navigations
- **Backend Required:** AI features require backend server on localhost:3000
- **Browser:** Best tested in Chrome with Developer Console open

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

### You know it's working when:
1. ✅ Profiles appear in dashboard with real names
2. ✅ No "message port closed" errors
3. ✅ AI researcher opens oldest profiles first
4. ✅ Comments only saved if they have @ symbols
5. ✅ Job seeker scores appear after research
6. ✅ No linter errors in console
