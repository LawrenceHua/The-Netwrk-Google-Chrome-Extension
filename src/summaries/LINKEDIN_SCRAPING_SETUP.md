# LinkedIn Scraping & AI Analysis - Complete Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how the LinkedIn scraping and AI analysis works, and how to set it up properly.

## How It Works

### 1. **Profile Collection (Phase 1)**
- Extension searches LinkedIn for job seekers using keywords
- Extracts: Name, Headline, LinkedIn URL
- Saves to dashboard with `needsResearch: true` flag

### 2. **Deep Research (Phase 2)**
The extension performs comprehensive research on each profile:

#### a) Main Profile Research
- Scrolls through profile page
- Clicks all "see more" buttons to expand content
- Extracts:
  - Name (via DOM selectors + text analysis)
  - Headline (via DOM selectors + text analysis)
  - About section (expanded content)
  - All visible text for AI analysis

#### b) Experience Page Research
- Navigates to `/details/experience/`
- Scrolls and expands all experiences
- Extracts:
  - Job titles and companies
  - Skills mentioned

#### c) Contact Info Research
- Navigates to `/overlay/contact-info/`
- Extracts:
  - Email addresses
  - Phone numbers

#### d) Comments Research
- Navigates to `/recent-activity/comments/`
- Scrolls through last 6 months of comments
- Filters for comments with @ symbols
- Extracts:
  - Comments containing @ mentions
  - Email addresses found in comments

#### e) AI Analysis
- Sends all collected data to backend API
- OpenAI (GPT-4o) analyzes:
  - Job seeker likelihood (0-100 score)
  - Career stage (Entry/Mid/Senior/Executive)
  - Tech background (Expert/Strong/Some/None)
  - Key skills and interests
  - Email extraction and validation
  - Job seeking indicators

### 3. **Dashboard Display**
- All analyzed data saved to Chrome storage
- Dashboard shows:
  - Job seeker score
  - Career stage & tech background
  - Emails found
  - AI summary and indicators

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd /Users/lawrencehua/Downloads/TheNetwrk/backend
npm install
```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
Create `/Users/lawrencehua/Downloads/TheNetwrk/backend/.env`:
```env
# OpenAI API Key (REQUIRED for AI analysis)

# Email Configuration (optional - for sending emails)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Server Port
PORT=3000
```

3. **Get OpenAI API Key**
- Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Create a new API key
- Copy it to your `.env` file

4. **Start Backend Server**
```bash
cd /Users/lawrencehua/Downloads/TheNetwrk/backend
npm start
```

You should see:
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" error

# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:3000/

# If not running, start it
cd /Users/lawrencehua/Downloads/TheNetwrk/backend
npm start
```

### Issue: "OpenAI API error"

**Problem:** Missing or invalid API key

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file has correct API key
2. Verify key works: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
3. Check API credits: https://platform.openai.com/usage

### Issue: "No data extracted from profile"

**Problem:** LinkedIn changed DOM structure or access denied

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you're logged into LinkedIn
2. Check Chrome console for errors
3. LinkedIn may have rate limits - wait a few minutes
4. Try manually navigating to profile first

### Issue: "Research stuck on a profile"

**Problem:** Page not loading or content script timeout

**Solution:**
1. Check Chrome console for errors
2. Stop research (click "Stop" button)
3. Clear any stuck tabs

## Cost Estimation

- **Profile Collection:** Free (uses Chrome extension)
- **AI Analysis:** ~1500 tokens per profile = $0.015 per profile (GPT-4o pricing)
- **Estimated cost:** $1.50 per 100 profiles analyzed

## Best Practices

1. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Don't research more than 10 profiles at once
   - Wait 5-10 seconds between profiles
   - LinkedIn may rate limit excessive requests

2. **API Usage:**
   - Monitor OpenAI usage: https://platform.openai.com/usage
   - Each comprehensive analysis uses ~1500 tokens
   - Set usage limits to avoid unexpected charges

3. **Data Quality:**
   - Verify scraped data in console logs
   - Check for common issues (missing names, bad headlines)
   - Use dashboard filters to find best prospects

4. **LinkedIn Terms:**
   - This tool is for personal research purposes
   - Respect LinkedIn's rate limits
   - Don't scrape excessively or abuse the platform

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Backend configured with OpenAI API key
