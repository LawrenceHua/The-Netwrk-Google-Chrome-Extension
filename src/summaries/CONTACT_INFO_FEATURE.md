# ✅ Contact Info Feature Added

## What Was Added

A new step in main profile research that clicks the "Contact info" button to check for emails!

### The Flow

```
MAIN PROFILE RESEARCH:

1. Navigate to profile (if needed)
2. Wait for page to settle (3 seconds)
3. ✨ NEW: Click "Contact info" → Extract email → Close modal
4. Scroll through profile (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
5. Click "see more" buttons
6. Extract name, headline, about, experiences, skills
7. Continue to comments research...
```

## How It Works

```javascript
async function clickContactInfoAndExtractEmail() {
  // 1. Find "Contact info" button
  const button = find button/link with text "contact info"
  
  // 2. Click it
  button.click()
  
  // 3. Wait for modal (2 seconds)
  await sleep(2000)
  
  // 4. Extract emails from modal
  const emails = extract all email patterns
  
  // Filter out:
  - linkedin.com emails
  - example.com
  - test.com
  
  // 5. Close modal (ESC key or X button)
  click close button OR press ESC
  
  // 6. Wait for modal to close
  await sleep(1000)
  
  // 7. Return emails
  return validEmails
}
```

## Console Output

When this runs, you'll see:

```

## What Gets Extracted

### From Contact Info Modal:

- ✅ Phone number (if public)
- ✅ Other contact details

### Added to Profile Data:
```javascript
{
  name: "John Doe",
  headline: "Software Engineer...",
  about: "Passionate developer...",
  experiences: [...],
  skills: [...],
  contactEmails: ["john.doe@example.com"], // ← NEW!
  commentEmails: [], // From comments page
  ...
}
```
